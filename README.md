# VSvim

This personal setup transforms VSCode into a platform that should feel like a native Vim distribution,
combining the best of both worlds for an efficient and comfortable coding environment.

This project is yet in early Alpha state - there might be issues with the setup!

## Overview
#### Simplicity
Streamlined for simplicity, this setup embraces a minimalist philosophy by removing most default keybindings.
The goal is to create a clean and uncluttered environment, offering a foundation where users can intentionally add and customize keybindings according to their preferences.
Take control of your coding experience by building upon this foundation to tailor it precisely to your workflow.
